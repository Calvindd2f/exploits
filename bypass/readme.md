AV/EDR evasion
Several AV and EDR evasion techniques are in use:

AMSI bypass: The PowerShell inline script disables AMSI by patching amsi.dll!AmsiScanBuffer to always return AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN.
DLL unhooking: Since EDR solutions monitor API calls by hooking ntdll.dll, these hooks need to be removed by loading a fresh copy of ntdll.dll from disk and restoring the original section. Otherwise, process hollowing would be detected.
